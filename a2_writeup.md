## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?
The part of the function with the % was definitely more difficult than any thing else we had to do, even the _ part. It wasn't too hard to figure out what to do, but I struggled with finding out how to implement code in order to complete what it was that I needed to do.


2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.
The match function could be used to extract info from a movie database by taking out information that relates to years/actors/producers/etc. The function can be used when needing information regarding the things mentioned above.
